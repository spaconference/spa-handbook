# Update and activate the CFP on the website

The CFP is a subsection of the [SPA website](https://github.com/spaconference/spa-website/), made up of the files

  * lead-a-session.md
  * info-for-speakers.md
  * interactivity.md
  * submission-stages.md
  * successful-sessions.md

The navigation menu for the CFP subsection is in the include file `_includes/lead-a-session-nav.html`.

To announce a CFP:

 1. Ensure these files are up to date and reflect the process and focus of this year's conference.
 2. Comment out the files in the `exclude` section of the `_config.yml` file, to make the CFP visible on the site.


# Publicise the CFP

## SPA attendees mailing list

As conference organiser, you have administrator privileges on the [SPA website](https://spaconference.org). On [your MySpa page](https://spaconference.org/scripts/myprofile.php), you can download a [list of everyone who has consented to be emailed](https://spaconference.org/scripts/org/users-csv.php).

Download that list and replace the list in mailchimp with it.  Then send the CFP to the list.

### Twitter

... How to post as the [@spaconference](https://twitter.com/spaconference) Twitter user?

### LinkedIn

Once the CfP is open Hibri Marzook or Raul Rodriguez can help granting access to SPA's LinkedIn page. No credentials are required but owning a personal LinkedIn account.

To publicise the CfP for the first time:

  1. The page's banner should be updated.
  2. An initial post to announce the opening of the CfP should be sent as soon as possible.

To send a post from SPA's LinkedIn page log in to your LinkedIn account, find the link to page's admin view and finally type and publish the post.
